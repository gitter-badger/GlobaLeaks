Dear %ReceiverName%

In the last hour, %NodeName% has received a large number of requests.
To avoid unnecessary overload of the system, the notification has been temporarily disabled.
Anyhow, as usual, If you login in %NodeName% you'll found all the recent activities from the Tip list.

Kind regards,
%NodeSignature%
